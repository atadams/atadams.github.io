00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.529
So, first I'd like to acknowledge my colleagues,
Dr. Sue Bakken is my mentor and is the PI

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.349
of one of the major projects I'll be talking
about today.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.509
And here you can also see our funding sources.
So today I'm going to talk about some of the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.930
opportunities that technology creates for
engaging patients, things that would not be

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.140
really possible or as straightforward or easy
without technology, and I'm going to do that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.860
in the form of two case studies, the first
talking about tailored visualization -- we're

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.739
talking about infographics and types of graphical
formats. And then I'm going to talk about

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.429
&lt;inaudible&gt; and that is an online maternity.
So first, WICER is the Washington Heights/Inwood

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.679
Informatics Infrastructure for Community-Centered
Comparative Effectiveness Research.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:54.329
This was a large AHRQ-funded project, had
lots of moving parts, including a hypertension

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.780
file, focused on hypertension, and the purpose
of this project was really to understand and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.739
enhance the health of the community. Here
we're talking about Washington Heights and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.830
Inwood. This is the neighborhood where Columbia
University Medical Center is located. This

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.990
is the community we serve. It's where I live
as well, and it's largely a Dominican neighborhood.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.590
So most of the people are Spanish-speaking,
and some also speak English. We sent community

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.170
health workers into the ambulatory care clinics,
into a community health center, and into people's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.470
homes, and we surveyed about 5800 people.
Blood pressure-- research-quality blood pressures,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.770
height, weight, waist circumference and a
whole slew of patient-reported outcomes, including

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.750
measures of mental health, nutrition, physical
activity, etcetera. And one of the really

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.500
great and innovative things about WICER was
the ability to then-- most of the people gave

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.990
the consent to have their survey data linked
to their clinical data at New York Presbyterian

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.400
Hospital, so that's a really rich data source
that's available, and also many of them agreed

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.720
to be contacted for future research. So we
now have this wonderful research cohort. Some

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.200
of them have given swabs for genomic studies,
et cetera.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.709
We believe-- and this is really with Sue Bakken's
leadership-- we really believe that we have

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.299
an ethical obligation to return the data to
the participants and to the community that

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.969
supported this project, but it's not enough
to say, "Here's a 60-page report, enjoy."

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:30.120
You really do need to give people information
in a way that they can find usable and actionable.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.060
So we also know from preliminary data that
levels of health literacy are quite varying

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:48.180
throughout the community but fairly low on
average, and I'm so glad that these wonderful

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.920
presenters have come before me and have already
done-- so I don't have to go into the backstory

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.230
about health literacy and the importance of
that towards comprehension. But also we've

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.609
seen that visualizations can support comprehension,
but a lot of the work has been done with risk

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.760
communication, so we saw those part-to-whole
relationships-- the likelihood of being affected

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.629
by breast cancer, for instance, out of a group
of people-- and unfortunately when we looked

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.749
at the types of data that we wanted to convey,
we really didn't see much in the literature

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:23.310
that would give us any guidance as to what
is the best way to present this information,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.129
because most of it really was about risk communication,
and we were showing things like fruit servings

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:36.919
per week, one-time point, fairly straightforward
information. So we engaged in a whole visualization

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.529
development process, and here you see an overview.
The first part involved iterative development

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:47.599
of prototypes, then focus group testing. ENTICE
is almost done-- at least the modules that

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.230
we're building are almost done-- and that
is the system that automatically generates

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.290
and tailors the graphics, and comprehension
testing is coming soon.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.249
So what we did was we put together the visualization
working group, and this included people from

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:08.620
nursing, biomedical informatics, medicine,
public health, and maybe, I don't know, 17,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.370
19 people, something like that-- sort of a
loose membership. And we looked first at what

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.349
kinds of variables do we have. What is it
that we need to visualize? And we matched

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:25.150
those variables to some standard graphical
formats, the kinds of which you see today,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.879
the kinds of things that are available off-the-shelf
in Excel, for instance. But we also added

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:37.289
our own innovative, novel formats, analogy-based
formats that you'll see in a few minutes.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:44.750
We engaged in iterative prototyping until
we felt like we had a few options for each

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.729
type of data that we wanted to convey. In
the process of doing that, we realized that

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.819
we had-- our main goal was to promote comprehension,
and what we had to do was: What are the cognitive

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:07.430
tasks that somebody needs to complete in order
to understand this information? And we started

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.340
to group our infographics according to those
tasks.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.430
So for instance, understanding what you said
about fruit servings per week; you just have

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.610
to identify a single value. But if you're
going to understand BMI, you have to identify

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.930
the value and then compare it to reference
ranges and then make some sort of judgment

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.990
about what that reference range means. So
it requires more tasks and the visualization

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.349
has to support more. So here's an example
of the development of one graphic. So here

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.470
on the left we have the initial prototype
that one of my colleagues, Michael Bales,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.190
put together, and he brought it to our group
and collectively we-- based on our group's

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.190
feedback, we came up with this one in the
middle. For instance, we took off the month

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:02.960
and we made it cleaner, more open, etcetera.
And then after revision by the focus group

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.819
participants, after iteration with them, we
came up with the one on the right. And we

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.580
cannot use this graphic, and I'll tell you
why in a minute.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.479
So, focus group testing. We conducted 21 groups,
over 100 participants. Most of the groups

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:26.080
were in Spanish. We gave our participants
a stack of cardstock with one graphic on each

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.419
piece of paper and everybody-- we assimilated
data so that everybody was looking at the

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.479
exact same graphic, and we asked people, "What
do you think we're trying to tell you?" And

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.590
the way we framed the exercise was, "If it's
not clear, that's our fault that we haven't

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.330
represented it well. So tell us what you think
we're trying to say. How do you interpret

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.449
this information? What do you like? What do
you not like?" We would have multiple versions,

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.169
the different prototypes for a particular
type of information. "Of these three, which

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.370
one do you like the best? How would you improve
it?" Et cetera.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:10.439
And 
here are our findings, in a nutshell, if you
want to refer back to them, but I'm actually

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:16.580
going to talk about them as I show you the
following slides. One thing that I thought

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.599
was really interesting was the information
that you gave us before about less is more,

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:27.629
and actually our participants told us over
and over again more is more. They found that--

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.509
they reminded us that just because someone
has lower health literacy does not mean they

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:36.039
have less desire for information. We just
need to find a way to present it in a way

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:41.340
that's going to be useful. So oftentimes,
when given the choice between different graphics,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.610
they wanted the one that had more information.
I also know from the research that what people

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.479
prefer isn't necessarily what supports comprehension
the most, so that's why we are doing formal

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:57.780
comprehension testing. But the process of
the focus groups did help us to do a preliminary

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.300
comprehension check based on how people were
interpreting the graphics. So we feel confident

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.749
that although the graphics won't all perform
equally well when we do comprehension testing,

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:11.479
we do have some confidence that people are
getting where we're going with these.

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:15.819
So, here's an example of a low-information
graphic. Most people understood this without

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:22.749
any problem. It's employing a familiar analogy.
We're using these stoplight colors to indicate

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:28.020
the reference ranges. But people generally
tended not to prefer this because it really

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.340
does not have very much information.
Compare it to this graphic, this was our most

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.680
popular graphic. People really liked this.
It still uses the stoplight analogy with the

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.349
colors and the double number lines, but it
provides a lot more information with the reference

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:48.339
ranges. You can see, "Oh, my systolic is 142
but I'm only two points away from the next

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:54.950
category over, and maybe I can nudge that."
And it also provides important context. So

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.000
you have there the picture of where the blood--
"Oh, this is how the blood pressure is taken.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.079
That's what they were doing. This is where
that number comes from," and some risks of

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:08.149
high blood pressure. I asked people, "Do you
want to see this information? What if your

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:12.269
blood pressure is normal?" They said, "No,
we still want to see it. This is really valuable."

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:16.930
And I had participants take these home. This
is not their blood pressure information, but

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.000
they had-- they said, "No, I'm going to put
this on my fridge," because they really valued

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.620
what they saw there.
Here's another example of a familiar analogy--

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.190
and actually, there's two analogies at play
here. One is the stoplight colors and the

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:39.740
other one is the concept of the battery. What
I took from this is that we need to employ

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.760
the images and iconography that people have
been trained to use, because, let me tell

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.750
you, you get trained really quick that you
need to pay attention to this icon, because

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.709
if you don't, your phone's going to die and
you're not going to be able to do what you

00:09:52.709 --> 00:10:00.079
want to do. So this kind of image-- I had
a few of my eldest ladies who did not understand

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:05.389
this, but pretty much most people understood
it and liked it and found it very useful.

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:11.630
So that analogy was very easy to use and people
also liked that you could compare it to something

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.990
else. When we had graphics that had just one
piece of information-- for instance, just

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.040
one battery, just Maria by herself in the
center-- people found it actually kind of

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.870
confusing. They didn't know-- "What's the
story? What's happening here?" People would

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:31.350
invent stuff. And when you add a comparison,
it actually makes it easier for people to

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.110
make sense of the graphic and it makes it
easier for people to use and understand. So

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.680
that was another important takeaway.
Here's another example of a familiar analogy.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:48.250
Again, there's nothing inherent about this
graphical convention that-- we're not born

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.870
knowing this, right? We've been trained by
Netflix, by Amazon, by restaurant ratings

00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:00.550
and movie ratings. We know how to use this,
and I was reminded of the fact that that's

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:07.589
not universal by a couple of my most elderly
ladies. I had one of them tell me that the

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:13.010
other men were in better health because they
only had two bad stars and three good stars.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.589
It had never occurred to me-- it would never
in a million years occur to me to interpret

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:20.970
that graphic in this way. So it just points
out the fact that we have been trained and

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.810
we do want to capitalize on the kinds of images
that people are used to using in their daily

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:35.720
lives.
So here's an example of icons that did not

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.790
work well. I had people who could tell me
that Maria was active. They could tell me

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:47.449
she was fast. But they could not tell me how
many days per week she exercised, which I

00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:53.500
found kind of baffling. But the fact is that
this is a convention. The graphical convention

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:59.170
of using repeated icons to represent repeated
instances of a more general class of things

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:06.350
was one that I had to conclude was not very
familiar to this population. Maybe in Europe,

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.509
where you see a lot more iconography, people
would be comfortable with this, but in our

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:14.800
neighborhood this didn't really fly. I mean,
a lot of people understood it, but many people

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.339
did not, whereas this one, people are familiar
with this. They know how to use this. So we

00:12:21.339 --> 00:12:22.759
tried all kinds of things with icons. We thought
icons would be great, and they just really,

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:23.459
really failed. And one of the things that
I noticed with this is that when people would

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:23.560
talk about this graphic, they would talk about
running, jogging, walking, but they would

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:23.649
never generalize to other forms of exercise--
swimming, soccer. And I would ask people,

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:23.759
"I want to represent exercise generally. Is
this a good example? Is this a good image?"

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:23.860
And they said yes, but they still would only
talk about running, walking, jogging, and

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:23.980
I said, "Can you think of anything else? Work
with me here." And nobody could come up with

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.480
anything better than this. So one of the things
that we found was we had a very, very difficult

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.180
time showing things at the right level of
abstraction. Exercise, fruits and vegetables

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:25.199
were the three main areas where we had problems
with this. It was just really, really difficult

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:25.230
because also people took things very literally.
We had another graphic just like this one

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.259
but with pairs of tennis shoes, and people
would say, "Oh, those are the shoes you have

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:25.269
to buy."
So here's another example of where we got

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.300
into literal interpretation. The original
version of this graphic had little apple icons,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:25.360
and people would look at this and they would
say, "So many apples." &lt;chuckles&gt; "Apples

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.360
every day. Victor eats a lot of apples." And
so their feedback to me was that I should

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.839
show a group of fruits so that people would
understand that it's not just apples. So I

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:25.940
work on my little graphic, I make my little
icons. I'm trying to make it so that it's

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.040
still legible even though it's small on the
page, and I come back with this, and the people

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.139
who saw the apples and then who saw this said,
"Oh, this is much better. This is much better

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:26.240
because then you can see that it's not just
apples, it's a variety of fruits." But the

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.320
people who only saw this said, "Same fruits
every day?" And I had people very carefully

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:26.440
scrutinizing the image-- "Pineapple, grapes..."
People were really looking at the details

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:26.470
of the image. So this-- people were really
interpreting this very literally, and it was

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.509
a very important message that we have to be
very careful about what goes into that message.

00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.540
I don't know if you remember the calendar.
Right? This is why we couldn't use the calendar,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:26.570
because we only knew-- this is a CDC 30-day
measure, so out of the last 30 days, were

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:26.610
you sad, blue or depressed, for instance--
and we had a graphic that had five days on

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:26.639
the calendar, and people would say, "Oh yes,
it's that time of the month for Maria," or

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:26.670
"Oh yes, she was depressed from the first
Sunday through the first Thursday of the month."

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.699
And our data are not that specific, but people--
that's how they interpreted it, and that's

00:12:26.699 --> 00:12:26.750
not what we're trying to say. So we're actually
going forward with a graphic that's not as

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.829
sexy, it's not as exciting, it's just little
blocks, it's a simple icon array, but people

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.899
understood it and they didn't attach additional
significance that we didn't intend.

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:26.990
So here are a few quotes that we got from
our focus group participants. As I said, some

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.070
people would take their entire stacks of graphics
home because they thought they were really

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.130
interesting and useful. I also have run four
pilot participants through the comprehension

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.230
study with graphics that I built by hand,
or that I tailored by hand, and I had one

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.290
who said this, that "It opens your mind so
that you can make changes to your own health,"

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.290
and I nearly started crying at my desk It
was like, "This is what we've been working

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.290
for for two years." So I think that we really
did see evidence of engagement and people

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300
said they found it motivating. Even just the
process of being participants in the focus

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.300
group-- people really values that as educational
and engaging.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.300
So this is the infrastructure-- rather, a
diagram for ENTICE. This is Electronic Tailored

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.310
Infographics for Community Engagement, Education
and Empowerment, and basically what this graphic

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.310
shows is that you have this blue box in the
middle that represents the web application

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.310
that is ENTICE, and it queries the survey
data for the metadata, the population data,

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320
and the individual data that it needs to then
go to the graphical components library, pull

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.320
the different pieces that it needs to then
assemble the graphic. And then this gray box

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.329
on the right represents the security. So this
is what verifies the users' identity, only

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:27.329
gives them access to the things that they
should access and not somebody else's data,

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:27.329
and creates an audit trail.
So here we've got our overall health graphic

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:27.339
again, and I've annotated it so that you can
see that, for instance, the title and the

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:27.339
response options-- that's the metadata. Here
you have Victor's, his individual data, and

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:27.339
then the population-level data there.
So we're, any day now, going to start comprehension

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:27.350
testing. It's a randomized control trial in
which each group serves as the other group's

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.350
control, and I'll show you exactly how we're
going to do that. We are comparing visualizations

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.350
to text for comprehension, perceived ease
of comprehension, and motivation for some

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360
of the items.
And here you can see an example, a sample

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.360
item. Maria is in Group A. She's going to
see the graphic for the depression symptoms

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.360
but the text for prolonged stress, whereas
Gloria, in Group B, she's going to see the

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.370
text for depression symptoms and the graphic
for prolonged stress. The way we can do this

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:27.370
is because each graphic has a buddy that's
either visually or conceptually very similar.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:27.380
Sometimes they're exactly the same, but the
user is not going to know that. And everybody

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:27.380
gets the same items. I very carefully built
the items so that everyone gets the same items;

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:27.380
everybody's just going to have a different
answer key. So primarily we're going for just

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:27.389
comprehension, not verbatim comprehension.
And then we also have-- this is a new graphic.

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.389
Nobody's seen this-- no participants have
seen this yet, so who knows if it'll work?

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.389
Who knows if they'll understand it, but it's
modeled after the Risks of High Blood pressure

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399
graphic, and we're asking, for the ones that
have a behavioral component, "Does this information

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:27.399
motivate you to take changes to how you manage
your health?" and then also, "Please rate

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:27.410
how difficult or easy this was to understand,"
and we're asking that for every single item,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.410
but text and graphic. And I've actually had
to move this item first-- this is why you

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.410
do pilots-- because I had a participant who
said to me-- who, talking aloud, clearly does

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420
not understand the graphic and doesn’t understand
the information, and then says it's very easy

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.420
on the how easy or difficult it is, and she
explained that, "Oh, she's quite sure that

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.430
she has no idea what it means." So I had to
move that first so that it's really, "How

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.430
are you interpreting the graphic?" and then
let's ask the content questions later. We'll

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.430
see if that helps.
So moving forward, I am going to-- I've just

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.430
been funded to work on this project with Hispanic
caregivers of dementia patients, and we're

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.430
going to be creating and adapting graphics
for them, where they can track their own health

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440
and that of the person for whom they're caring.
But here we're going to get into different

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.440
types of visualizations. We're going to get
into tracking trends over time. So that's

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.440
going to be a whole different thing. Probably
going to get more into line graphs and that

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.449
kind of thing, because there's not-- maybe
some animation-- there's not a lot of different

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:28.449
ways of doing that that I've seen that are
better than that. But we also want to talk

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:28.449
about how this is applicable to Obama's precision
medicine initiative because there's a lot

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:28.459
of communication that then happens. What are
your genomic results? What does the evidence

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:28.459
say about what is going to work for you? How
do we track your signs and symptoms over time?

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:28.470
And I think there's a lot of applicability
for visualizations in that context.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.470
So, changing focus a little bit, I'm going
to talk about the second case study, which

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.470
is-- this is the project that I'm originating
that I'm calling Maternity Information Access

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480
Point, or "My App" in English, or "Mi App"
in Spanish-- and this-- I'm reminded of something

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.480
that a doula told me recently. She said that
she tells her patients, "You are your own

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.490
primary care provider," and this is the patients
who sometimes are not so-- they're kind of

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.490
reluctant to engage, and she says, "No, no,
no, you are your own primary care provider.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.490
You're the one who makes these day-to-day
decisions about how you're going to feed yourself,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500
your hygiene, your activities," et cetera.
And so this is-- when we get into pregnancy,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.500
you get into women have to make lots and lots
of decisions, lots of self-management decisions.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.500
They're hoovering up information like crazy,
and they have to be preloaded with the knowledge,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.509
but intrapartum is not the time for a decision
aid, generally. You usually don't have time

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.509
to-- maybe you have a few minutes, but you
don't have time to really research and think

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519
about it and hem and haw. You really have
to preload women with all this information

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:28.519
so that when they need it, if they need it--
there's a lot of uncertainty-- they can access

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:28.519
it.
So my tech partner is called Maternity Neighborhood,

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:28.529
and they are-- they're really cool. They make
an electronic health record that is designed

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:28.529
with the needs of midwives and birth centers
in mind. It's specifically for maternity care,

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:28.529
and they have a new product called Care Guide
that is an online maternity education platform.

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:28.540
So the provider would give their client a
login and invite them to see a whole library

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:28.540
of curated, high-quality information. The
provider can also load up in their own information,

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:28.550
whatever documents they want to put up there,
and they can message securely around that

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.550
content. It can also be integrated with the
EHR so that the provider can say, "Oh, you've

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.550
got this glucose test coming up. Here's some
information. Please sign this e-consent,"

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560
and the engagement gets documented right into
the EHR. So my concern is-- I'm interested

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:28.560
a lot in underserved populations and health
literacy-- are we meeting the needs of these

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:28.560
women? Are we meeting everybody's needs with
this kind of product?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:28.570
So this is a qualitative study to look at
the acceptability and the feasibility of this

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:28.570
for Medicaid-enrolled women. So, just started
last Friday collecting data-- recruitment

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:28.570
is difficult-- but we are running four different
groups, English and Spanish, first-time moms

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:28.579
and experienced moms, and in the initial group
we're looking at barriers and facilitators

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:28.579
of Internet access, how women are using the
Internet for maternity care information, what

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:28.579
sources, Internet and other, they're using,
what are they preferring, how they get the

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:28.589
information, and what they think about this
idea of this platform, whether they think

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:28.589
they would use it, what they would like about
it or not, and then a field-testing period

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:28.589
of one month. They'll go home. We give them
a mobile hotspot so that they always have

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:28.600
as much data as they need, and we will be
messaging with them as though we're the provider.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:28.600
We can't give them specific medical information
but we can support their education efforts.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:28.610
And then in the course of their usage, the
system logs all of the user actions so later

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.610
on we can download those log files and see
what did they use, what did they look at,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620
when, how long, how much did they use it or
not, and then we'll bring them back a month

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:28.620
later and do standardized metrics of usability
and user satisfaction and talk about their

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:28.620
experiences-- what did they like, what did
they not like, what can we improve. So that's

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:28.630
happening now.
And so the future directions for that project

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:28.630
will really depend on what do we find, where
does it make sense to go next, but one possibility

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:28.630
is definitely to study the effect of this
kind of platform on clinical outcomes. Right

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:28.639
now it's just maternity. I think it has group
applicability to all kinds of other conditions.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:28.639
Diabetes. You're newly diagnosed with diabetes,
you have a lot of information that you need

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:28.649
to learn and process over a long period of
time, and this is I think the kind of technology

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:28.649
tool that would be really useful to support
that. The other thing that I've been thinking

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:28.649
about is these log files. What if we could
analyze them in real-time, as people are using

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:28.660
them, so that we can use their usage patterns
to inform clinical care? What is that people

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:28.660
are-- what resources are they hitting again
and again? What are we not-- maybe we need

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:28.670
to spend more time on that in our clinical
encounters because-- what search terms are

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.670
people using? Maybe we should rewrite our
materials to match the search terms that people

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.670
are using because this is the language that
they're bringing to the table.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680
So. I just want to conclude by mentioning
again that technology is what makes some of

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.680
this large-scale tailoring possible. It certainly
eases dissemination when you have something

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.680
that's web-based, and it can really support
that client and clinician communication. Both

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.690
visualizations and the platform can do that.
And this question of the log files, we have

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:28.690
all these data streams that we should be and
can be harnessing to promote a learning health

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:28.690
system, and I think the log files, capturing
user actions on an educational system, is

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:28.699
a great example of a way that we can contribute
to the learning health system by harnessing

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:28.699
that data stream. So moving forward, the research
priorities that I think are important are

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:28.709
looking at what is the optimal format to visualize
different types of data. Because we've looked

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:28.709
at just a narrow slice, but there's a lot
out there that we might want to visualize

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:28.720
that hasn't been tested yet. So I think we
still need to do a lot of work in that regard,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:28.720
find ways of saying other things, and also
really being cognizant of what is going to

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:28.720
work in your local environment, because your
mileage may vary. What worked in our setting

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:28.730
may not work in yours, and it's-- the thing
with icons in particular really drove home

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.730
that message, that you can't assume that your
idea is going to work where you are. So I

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.730
encourage you to ask people. Thank you.
